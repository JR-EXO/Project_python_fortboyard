Project : Projet python fort boyard

Author : Jery Razafindrabe, Hillel Israel

The project is python made game inspired by the famous tv show *Fort Boyard*.
You have to collect several key, through different challenges, to open the final treasure room. You will be in team, and each member will have to complete these challenges.

We used python via pycharm to make this project.

We first had to get pycharm, and then create a git account to post our work on our Git.

The game have to be lauched by clicking on the main.py file.

Well, first of all we had to think how to assemble everything. We know that every challenge won get you a key. So we did this :
- Create each challenge
- Make files to gather every challenge with same topics (maths, logic…)
- Make utility function
- Make the final final with the game function

List of all function :

Chance challenges :

shell_game():
A guessing game where the player has two attempts to find a hidden key under one of three labeled shells (A, B, or C). Feedback is provided after each guess.

roll_dice_game():
A dice-rolling competition where the player competes against a game master to roll a 6 within three attempts. The first to roll a 6 wins; if neither rolls a 6, the game ends in a draw.

chance_challenge():
Randomly selects and executes one of the available challenge games (either shell_game or roll_dice_game).

Final challenge :

treasure_room():
A game where the player uses clues to guess a codeword and gain access to the treasure room. The clues and codeword are loaded from a JSON file named TRClues.json. The player has three attempts, with an additional clue provided after the first three attempts if needed.

Logical challenges :

display_sticks(n)
Displays a vertical line (|) for each stick remaining in the game.

player_removal(n)
Prompts the player to remove 1, 2, or 3 sticks from the total. Validates the input to ensure it complies with the rules.

master_removal(n)
Determines the optimal number of sticks (1-3) for the game master to remove using a strategy based on modulo arithmetic.

nim_game()
Implements the classic game of Nim, where players alternately remove sticks, aiming to avoid being the one to take the last stick.

display_grid(grid)
Prints a grid (used for games like Tic-Tac-Toe).

check_victory(grid, symbol)
Checks if a given symbol (X or O) has achieved victory by completing a row, column, or diagonal in a grid.

master_move(grid, symbol)
Determines the game master's optimal move in Tic-Tac-Toe, prioritizing victory, blocking, or choosing a random position.

player_turn(grid)
Prompts the player to make a move in the Tic-Tac-Toe game by specifying a row and column.

master_turn(grid)
Executes the game master's move in the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the master_move strategy.

full_grid(grid)
Checks if the Tic-Tac-Toe grid is completely filled with no empty spaces.

check_result(grid)
Determines the result of a Tic-Tac-Toe game by checking for a victory or a draw.

tictactoe_game()
Runs a full Tic-Tac-Toe game between a player (X) and the game master (O).

next_player(player)
Alternates between players, returning the next player in turn.

empty_grid2()
Initializes and returns an empty 3x3 grid for the Battleship game.

display_grid2(grid2, message)
Displays a grid (used in the Battleship game) along with a custom message.

ask_position()
Prompts the player to input a position (row and column) for actions like placing or shooting.

initialize()
Initializes the Battleship grid by allowing the player to place boats on the grid.

turn(player, player_shots_grid2, opponent_grid2)
Executes a turn in the Battleship game for the specified player, determining hits or misses.

has_won(player_shots_grid)
Checks if a player has won the Battleship game by sinking all opponent boats.

battleship_game()
Runs a full Battleship game where players aim to sink the opponent's boats on a 3x3 grid.

logical_challenge()
Randomly selects and executes one of the logical games (tictactoe_game, battleship_game, or nim_game).

Main :

game()
This is the main function that orchestrates the game's flow

Math challenges :

factorial(n): Calculates the factorial of a given number n recursively. If n is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns n multiplied by the factorial of n - 1.

math_challenge_factorial(): Presents a challenge where the player must calculate the factorial of a randomly chosen number between 1 and 10. If the player's answer is correct, they win a key.

solve_linear_equation(): Generates a linear equation of the form ax + b = 0 with random coefficients a and b, then computes and returns the values of a, b, and x (the solution).

math_challenge_equation(): Challenges the player to solve a linear equation generated by solve_linear_equation(). The player must input the value of x that satisfies the equation. If correct, they win a key.

is_prime(n): Checks whether a given number n is a prime number by testing divisibility from 2 to n-1.

nearest_prime(n): Finds the nearest prime number greater than a given number n. It increments n until a prime number is found.

math_challenge_prime(): Asks the player to find the nearest prime number greater than a randomly chosen number between 1 and 10. If the player's answer is correct, they win a key.

math_roulette_challenge(): Presents a math challenge involving a random arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication) on five randomly chosen numbers between 1 and 20. The player must compute and provide the correct result. If correct, they win a key.

math_challenge(): Randomly selects one of the math challenges (math_challenge_factorial, math_challenge_equation, math_challenge_prime, or math_roulette_challenge) and executes it. The function returns the result of the selected challenge.

Père fourras riddles : 

load_riddles(file): Loads riddles from a specified JSON file.

pere_fouras_riddles(): Presents a riddle to the player as part of the Père Fouras challenge.



We actually forgot to do a logbook, but here's the project part repartition :
Jery : Maths challenges, logical challenges(1st part), utility function, main
Hillel : Chance challenge, père fouras challenge, logical challenges(2nd part), final challenges

We first tested each function one by one and then the whole thing together.
